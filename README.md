# Luci-Midterm-Project

## Description
In this REST API project I built a banking system. The system has 4 types of Accounts:
- Student Checking
- Checking
- Credit Card
- Savings
It has 3 types of Users too:
- AccountHolder
- Admin
- Third Party

Admins can create new accounts, but only Checking, Credit Card or Savings. They have access to the balance to any account and they can modify it as well.
AccountHolders have access to their balance and the can transfer money to any other account.
Thir Party Users can receive and send money with their hashed key.
